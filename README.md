# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
We must complete additional tasks to examine data extracted from Google Maps, specifically:
* Adding the weather description to the weather data
* Add user statement asking for temperature range; this will be used to identify potential hotels and countries
* The user will then select four cities for a road trip

### Purpose
To pull data from WeatherNow and Google Maps APIs. Weather data was used to define bands of desirable temperatures. Latitudes and longitudes were determined by a random number generator set to produce numbers that matched the format of lat/long. Google Maps APIs provided hotel information and location information to determine proper hotels in our desired temperature bands.
